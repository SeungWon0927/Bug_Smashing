# Bug_Smashing
 
This program was created by Unity ver 2019.02.18f1
Uploaded to github with gitignore = "Unity" for storage, so no apk file included

Playable with Oculus Quest - Open "Haptic" Scene in Unity
 
1. To make real-size table, press 'A' button of right hand to measure bottom left corner
 and 'B' button for top right corner.
2. To start bug smashing demo, press 'oculus button' of left hand and the bugs will appear 
on the table. (I added popping motion when bugs collide with themselves)

To watch how it works, go to my project web, "https://www.notion.so/purdueseungwon/Seung-Won-Kim-s-Works-42199ff8965741f19480821a4cd61d23", and check "VR Bug Smashing Game" section
